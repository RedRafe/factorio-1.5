# Factorio 1.5

> *Less is more!*

An underhaul for Factorio and Space Age, bringing (not all of) Space Age features back on vanilla Nauvis!

### Features
---

This mod is a simple version of Factorio Space Age that feels more like Factorio 1.1 than Space Age itself. All new Space Age entities can be built on Nauvis like an additional tier of machines in the vanilla game.

- No new planets (Aquilo, Fulgora, Gleba, Vulcanus, Shattered)
- No new spaceships
- No space platform
- No new science packs
- No new enemies
- No spoiling

These are instead kept:
- Quality
- Turbo belts
- Stack inserter
- Belt stacking
- Mech armor
- MK3 Battery equipment, Toolbelt equipment, Fusion Reactor equipment
- Railgun, Teslagun
- Rocket turret, Tesla turret, Railgun turret
- Infinite researches
- T2 Machines: Foundry, EM-plant, Cryo-plant, Bio-chamber, Big-miner, Recycler, Fusion reactors

### Settings
---

A few of my personal tweaks are also available to be turned ON/OFF if you wish:

- *Friendly colors*: entities are color-coded with a richer palette in map view
- *Fusion fuel*: allow vehicles to use fusion fuel cells as insane source of speed/acceleration
- *Loaders stack*: loaders stack items on belts just like stack inserters
- *Mixed ores*: add mixed ore to terrain generation
- *Quality wagons*: wagons's capacity increases with quality
